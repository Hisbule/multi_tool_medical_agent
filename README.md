 # Multi-Tool Medical Agent

An AI-powered CLI tool that interacts with medical datasets (heart disease, cancer, diabetes) and performs web-based medical queries.
It is a user interface-based system where you can ask any question in plain English text — no coding required.
If your question is related to data but you don’t mention the dataset name, the system will automatically ask you to choose a database before running the query.
The whole process is fully automatic and interactive..
